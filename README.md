I am currently preparing for my career in the ever changing world of cybersecurity. This is a place for me to show off some skills I have learned over the past while to further my education, aswell as skills that I have picked up along the way during simple Python programming or computer maintenance/troubleshooting.

## Objective

When I graduate, I aim to get my foot in the door and hit the ground running with my profound interest in the world of technology and ever-growing skillset, and I am eager to aim for a career in security analysis as I love being able to protect, defend and respond to any current/future threat that may show itself.
